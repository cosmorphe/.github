# Cosmorphē / cosmorphe

**Emerging new forms from the tension between order and transformation.**

## 🌌 Vision

Cosmorphē is a word born from Cosmos (the ordered whole) and Morphē (form, formality).

Here, morphē does not mean a static or fixed shape.  
It signifies a form that emerges through ongoing change and transformation —  
a temporary equilibrium that arises in the tension between order and flux.  
Such forms appear, dissolve, and shift into new ones.

Cosmorphē stands as a guiding beacon:  
an ideal vision of the whole that can never be fully attained,  
yet remains something we must always strive toward.  
It resonates both with the scientific endeavor to seek the laws of nature,  
and with the creative interplay between humans and generative AI,  
where new orders emerge within transformation.  

This project is conceived as a place where order and transformation become the source of creation —  
where we explore and give shape to the forms that emerge in between.  

Here, participants are invited to embrace change without fear,  
to enjoy the moments of emergence,  
and to move closer, step by step, toward Cosmorphē through their own acts of creation.

# Cosmorphē（コスモルフェ）

**秩序と変容のせめぎ合いから、新しい形が創発する。**

## 🌌 理念

「Cosmorphē（コスモルフェ）」は、  
*Cosmos*（秩序ある全体）と *Morphē*（形相）から生まれた言葉です。  

Morphē は単なる静止した形ではなく、  
絶え間ない変化や変容を経て、その時々に立ち現れる「形相」を意味します。  
秩序と変容がせめぎ合う中で、一時的に均衡を保ちながら生まれる「全体の形」。  
それはすぐに崩れ、また次の形へと移ろいます。  

**Cosmorphē** は、  
「到達することはできないが、常に志向し続けるべき理想の全体像」を示す旗印です。  
それは科学が自然の法則を探り続ける営みとも、  
生成AIと人間のインタラクションの中で創発される新しい秩序とも重なります。  

このプロジェクトは、  
**秩序と変容のせめぎ合いを創造の源泉とし、  
そこから立ち現れる新しい形を共に探究し、形にしていく場** です。  

参加する人は誰もが、  
変化を恐れず、創発の瞬間を楽しみ、  
自らの創造を通じて **Cosmorphē** に少しずつ近づいていきます。
